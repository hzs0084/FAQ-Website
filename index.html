            Q3. What is the naming convention for assignment submissions and how do I make submissions on Canvas?
            <p>
            <br> The naming convention for assignment submissions is: "username_PA#". For example, if I were to submit programming assignment 1, I would name it "hzs0084_PA1". 
            <br> Failure to follow this naming convention will result in a <strong>0 </strong> the assignment. If a student submits an assignment with the wrong naming convention and the submission deadline has passed. 
            <br> It's upto the instructor's discretion whether or not to accept the assignment. If the assignment is accepted, the student will receive a <strong>20% </strong> on the assignment.
            <br> All the submissions should be in a zip file. You can submit that zip file on Canvas.

            <br> If the usage of any AI tools is found in your code. You will receive a <strong> 0 </strong>for the assignment. Since AI is generating the code for you and it's not your own work, it will be considered as plagrism.

                Each student will get two late days for the semester. You can use these late days for any assignment but you have to reach out to the TA to let them know you are going to use a late day
