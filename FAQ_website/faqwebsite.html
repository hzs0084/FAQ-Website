                    <li>
                        For C# development, you'll need the .NET SDK. Install it from the official .NET website: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank"> Download .Net SDK</a>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To verify that you have the C# extension installed, open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon on the left side of the screen. Then search for C# and you should see the C# extension.
                        <br>Another way to ensure that you have everything set up correctly is to open the terminal in VS Code and type in "dotnet --version". If you see a version number, you're good to go. Below is an example of what you should see.

                </div>
                The error messages in Visual Studio Code are self-explanatory but if you don't know where to look at it can be pretty confusing. In the above example, the error message is telling us that there's a missing semi-colon in line 53.
                <br> The error message also tells us the file name and the line number where the error is located. 
                 Since VS Code is trying to be precise, it's pointing the exact location where the error occurred. "53" is the line number where the error is located.
                "22" is the column number within that line where the error is expected.
                <br> The error message also tells us the type of error. In this case, it's a syntax error. The error message also tells us the error code. In this case, it's CS1002.The error message also tells us the error type. In this case, it's a syntax error. The error message also tells us the error description. In this case, it's telling us that it's expecting a semi colon on the line. 
                
                <div class="question7-error-message-in-code">

                <p>
                    There's also a red squiggly line under the line where the error is located. This is another way of telling us that there's an error in the code. If you hover over the red squiggly line, it will tell you the same thing as the error message.

                    Int is short for integer. Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 are all integers. -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -0 are also integers.
                    <br> Integers can't have decimal points. For example, 1.5 is not an integer. 1.5 is a double.
                    <br> Integers can't have commas. For example, 1,000 is not an integer. 1,000 is a string.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Double is short for double precision floating point. Doubles are numbers that can have decimal points. For example, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 0.5 are all doubles. -1.5, -2.5, -3.5, -4.5, -5.5, -6.5, -7.5, -8.5, -9.5, -0.5 are also doubles.
                    <br> Doubles can't have commas. For example, 1,000.5 is not a double. 1,000.5 is a string.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    String is short for string of characters. Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, "Hello World" is a string. "Hello World" is a sequence of characters. "Hello World" is not a number.
                    <br> Strings can't have decimal points. For example, 1.5 is not a string. 1.5 is a double.
                    <br> Strings can't have commas. For example, 1,000 is not a string. 1,000 is an integer.

                    A variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a variable can change. For example, int x = 5; is a variable.

                <p>
                    A constant is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a constant can't change. For example, const int x = 5; is a constant.
                    <br> We define constants because throughout the code we don't want to change the value of the variable. For example, if we're using the value of pi in our code, we don't want to change the value of pi. We want to keep it constant.

                <p>
                    Pseudocode is a way of writing code in plain English.  It helps programmers plan out how they want their software to work before actually implementing it. 
                    <br> You need to submit a .txt file or a Microsoft Word file to count as a submission for your assignment. You only need to write Pseudocode for Programming Assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br><b>Here is an example of Pseudocode for a program that calculates the cookie consumption:</b>
                    <br>// Declare Variables that hold Calories per Oreo, Oreos consumed, total calories, and servings
                    <br>declare const int oreoCalories = 56;
                    <br>declare double oreosConsumed;
                    <br>declare double totalServings;
                    <br>declare double totalCalories;
                    <br>// Let the user input the amount of Oreos they have consumed and store input in oreosConsumed
                    <br>Display “Enter the number of Oreo Cookies eaten.”;
                    <br>Input oreosConsumed;
                    <br>// Calculate the total amount of calories consumed (# of oreosConsumed * oreoCalories)
                    <br>totalCalories = (oreosConsumed * oreoCalories);
                    <br>Display “Here are the number of calories eaten: “ (totalCalories);
                    <br>// Calculate the number of servings consumed (# of oreosConsumed / 2)
                    <br>totalServings = (oreosConsumed / 2);
