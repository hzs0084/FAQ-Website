                    <br>In this course, it is expected that all submitted work is produced by the students themselves, whether individually or collaboratively. Students must not seek the assistance of Generative AI Tools like ChatGPT for graded assignments. Use of a Generative AI Tool to complete an assignment constitutes academic dishonesty. Students may use Generative AI tools as a study tool, but be forewarned that AI tools are not trustworthy.
                    <br>If you have any more quetions about the AI Policy, please reach out to the instructor.

                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            For C# development, you'll need the .NET SDK. Install it from the official .NET website: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank"> Download .Net SDK</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on this link and then follow the steps to install the C# extension for VS Code: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp" target="_blank"> C# Extension for VS Code</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To verify that you have the C# extension installed, open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon on the left side of the screen. Then search for C# and you should see the C# extension.
                            <br>Another way to ensure that you have everything set up correctly is to open the terminal in VS Code and type in "dotnet --version". If you see a version number, you're good to go. Below is an example of what you should see.
                            <div class="dotnet-version-terminal-cmd">

                            Ideally, you can use create a test project and run it. A simple project of Hello World should be enough to verify that everything is working correctly.

                        We highly recommend that you save your code in the One Drive folder on the Virtual Lab. This will make it easier for you to access your code from anywhere.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The naming convention for assignment submissions is: "username_PA#". For example, if I were to submit programming assignment 1, I would name it "hzs0084_PA1". 
                        <br> Failure to follow this naming convention will result in a <strong>0 </strong> the assignment. If a student submits an assignment with the wrong naming convention and the submission deadline has passed. 
                        <br> It's upto the instructor's discretion whether or not to accept the assignment. If the assignment is accepted, the student will receive a <strong>20% </strong> on the assignment.
                        <br> All the submissions should be in a zip file. You can submit that zip file on Canvas.

                        Each student will get two late days for the semester. You can use these late days for any assignment but you have to reach out to the TA to let them know you are going to use a late day
                    so that the TA doesn't take off any late points. Otherwise as stated in syllabus there will be a <strong>20%</strong> deduction as late penalty.

                    The error messages in Visual Studio Code are self-explanatory but if you don't know where to look at it can be pretty confusing. In the above example, the error message is telling us that there's a missing semi-colon in line 53.
                    <br> The error message also tells us the file name and the line number where the error is located. 
                     Since VS Code is trying to be precise, it's pointing the exact location where the error occurred. "53" is the line number where the error is located.
                    "22" is the column number within that line where the error is expected.
                    <br> The error message also tells us the type of error. In this case, it's a syntax error. The error message also tells us the error code. In this case, it's CS1002.The error message also tells us the error type. In this case, it's a syntax error. The error message also tells us the error description. In this case, it's telling us that it's expecting a semi colon on the line. 
                    
                    <div class="question7-error-message-in-code">

                    <p>
                        There's also a red squiggly line under the line where the error is located. This is another way of telling us that there's an error in the code. If you hover over the red squiggly line, it will tell you the same thing as the error message.

                        Int is short for integer. Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 are all integers. -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -0 are also integers.
                        <br> Integers can't have decimal points. For example, 1.5 is not an integer. 1.5 is a double.
                        <br> Integers can't have commas. For example, 1,000 is not an integer. 1,000 is a string.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Double is short for double precision floating point. Doubles are numbers that can have decimal points. For example, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 0.5 are all doubles. -1.5, -2.5, -3.5, -4.5, -5.5, -6.5, -7.5, -8.5, -9.5, -0.5 are also doubles.
                        <br> Doubles can't have commas. For example, 1,000.5 is not a double. 1,000.5 is a string.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        String is short for string of characters. Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, "Hello World" is a string. "Hello World" is a sequence of characters. "Hello World" is not a number.
                        <br> Strings can't have decimal points. For example, 1.5 is not a string. 1.5 is a double.
                        <br> Strings can't have commas. For example, 1,000 is not a string. 1,000 is an integer.

                        A variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a variable can change. For example, int x = 5; is a variable. The name of the variable is x and the value of the variable is 5. The value of the variable can change. For example, x = 10; is a valid statement. The value of the variable x is now 10.
                        <br> A constant is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a constant can't change. For example, const int x = 5; is a constant. The name of the constant is x and the value of the constant is 5. The value of the constant can't change. For example, x = 10; is not a valid statement. The value of the constant x can't change.

                        Console.WriteLine() is a method that prints the value of the variable inside the parenthesis to the console. For example, Console.WriteLine("Hello World"); will print Hello World to the console.
                        <br> When we refer to the console, we're referring to the terminal. The terminal is the black screen that you see in VS Code. The terminal is also known as the command line.
                        <br> In simple terms. we are asking VS Code to write an output to the terminal. The output is the value of the variable inside the parenthesis. In this case, the output is Hello World.

                        Console.ReadLine() is a method that reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. For example, string name = Console.ReadLine(); will read the input from the user and store it in a variable called name.
                        <br> When we refer to the console, we're referring to the terminal. The terminal is the black screen that you see in VS Code. The terminal is also known as the command line.
                        <br> In simple terms. we are asking VS Code to read the input from the user and store it in a variable. The variable is name. The input is the value that the user enters in the terminal. In this case, the input is the user's name.

                        A variable is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a variable can change. For example, int x = 5; is a variable.
                        <br> The name of the variable is x and the value of the variable is 5. The value of the variable can change. For example, x = 10; is a valid statement. The value of the variable x is now 10.

                        A constant is a storage location that has a name and a value. The value of a constant can't change. For example, const int x = 5; is a constant.
                        <br> We define constants because throughout the code we don't want to change the value of the variable. For example, if we're using the value of pi in our code, we don't want to change the value of pi. We want to keep it constant.
